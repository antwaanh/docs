= File uploads

toc::[]

File uploads have been reimagined in 4.0 and give you enough ways to process files securely and without wasting the server resources.

== Basic example
Let's see how to handle files uploaded by HTML form.

[source, edge]
----
<form method="POST" action="upload" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="profile_pic" />
  <button type="submit"> Submit </button>
</form>
----

Registering route

[source, js]
----
const Helpers = use('Helpers')

Route.post('upload', async ({ request }) => {
  const profilePic = request.file('profile_pic', {
    types: ['image'],
    size: '2mb'
  })

  await profilePic.move(Helpers.tmpPath('uploads'), {
    name: 'custom-name.jpg'
  })

  if (!profilePic.moved()) {
    return profilePic.error()
  }
  return 'File moved'
})
----

1. The `request.file` method accepts two arguments, a *field name* and *an object of validations* to be performed, before moving the file.
2. Next, we call `profilePic.move` method, which attempts to move the file to the defined directory. You can call it with options to save file with new name.
3. Finally, we check whether the move operation was successful or not using `profilePic.moved()` method and return errors (if any).

== Multiple file uploads
Uploading multiple files at a time is as simple as uploading one file. The `request.file` method returns a link:https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-bodyparser/blob/develop/src/Multipart/FileJar.js[File jar, window="_blank"] in case of multiple files.

[source, edge]
----
<form method="POST" action="upload" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="profile_pics[]" multiple />
  <button type="submit"> Submit </button>
</form>
----

[source, js]
----
const Helpers = use('Helpers')

Route.post('upload', async ({ request }) => {
  const profilePics = request.file('profile_pics', {
    types: ['image'],
    size: '2mb'
  })

  await profilePics.moveAll(Helpers.tmpPath('uploads'))

  if (!profilePics.movedAll()) {
    return profilePics.errors()
  }
})
----

The route handler code has been changed a bit in case of multiple file uploads.

[ol-spaced]
1. Instead of using `move`, we make use of `moveAll` method. Which parallelly moves all of the uploaded files to a given directory.
2. Also, other methods have been changed as `moved -> movedAll` and `error -> errors`.

=== Changing file names
When moving a single file, you can pass an object with `name` property on it. However, it can get tricky with multiple files.

AdonisJs allows you to pass a callback to `moveAll` method, which is executed for each file inside the `fileJar`.

[source, js]
----
profilePics.moveAll(Helpers.tmpPath('uploads'), (file) => {
  return {
    name: `${new Date().getTime()}.${file.subtype}`
  }
})
----

=== Moved list
In case of multiple file uploads, it's possible that only few files are successfully moved and other are rejected due to validation failures.

In that case you can make use of `movedAll()` and `movedList()` methods, to optimize your workflow.

[source, js]
----
const removeFile = Helpers.promisify(fs.unlink)

if (!profilePics.movedAll()) {
  const movedFiles = profilePics.movedList()

  await Promise.all(movedFiles.map((file) => {
    return removeFile(path.join(file._location, file._fileName))
  }))

  return profilePics.errors()
}
----

== Errors
Following is the list of formats in which error(s) are returned.

NOTE: When using link:https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-bodyparser/blob/develop/src/Multipart/FileJar.js[FileJar, window="_blank"] the `errors` method returns an array of following errors.

.Type error
[source, js]
----
{
  fieldName: "profile_pic",
  clientName: "GitHub-Mark.ai",
  message: "Invalid file type postscript or application. Only image is allowed",
  type: "type"
}
----

.Size error
[source, js]
----
{
  fieldName: "profile_pic",
  clientName: "adonis_landing.sketch",
  message: "File size should be less than 2MB",
  type: "size"
}
----

Also, multiple file uploads `errors` method returns an array of errors in the same format.

== File properties
Below is the list of file properties you can access on the file instance.

[role="resource-table", options="header", cols="45, 20, 20, 15"]
|====
| Property | Unprocessed | Inside tmp | Moved
| clientName [description]#File name on client machine# | `String` | `String` | `String`
| fileName [description]#File name after move operation# | `null` | `null` | `String`
| fieldName [description]#Form field name# | `String` | `String` | `String`
| tmpPath [description]#Temporary path#| `null` | `String` | `String`
| size [description]#File size in bytes#| `0` | `Number` | `Number`
| type [description]#File primary type#| `String` | `String` | `String`
| subtype [description]#File sub type#| `String` | `String` | `String`
| status [description]#File status. Set to `error` when fails#| `pending` | `consumed` | `moved`
|====

== Streaming files
Majority of file uploading libraries/frameworks process the files for multiple times when you want to stream them to an external service like *s3*.

Here's how the file uploading workflows are usually designed.

1. Process all the request files and save them into the `tmp` directory.
2. Move that file from the `tmp` directory to the destination directory.
3. Use *aws SDK* and then stream the file to s3.

This process wastes a bunch of server resources since a single file is getting *read* and *written* for multiple times. On the other hand, AdonisJs makes the process of streaming files smooth and efficient.

=== Disable auto processing
The config file `config/bodyparser.js` has a section to disable auto-processing of files for some selected routes.

[source, js]
----
processManually: ['upload']
----

The `processManually` option takes an array of routes or route patterns, for which files should not be processed automatically.

=== Process inside the controller
Next thing we need to do is call the `process` method inside the controller/route handler.

[source, js]
----
const Drive = use('Drive')

Route.post('upload', async ({ request }) => {

  request.multipart.file('profile_pic', {}, async (file) => {
    await Drive.disk('s3').put(file.clientName, file.stream)
  })

  await request.multipart.process()
})
----

NOTE: Always make sure to call `await request.multipart.process()` to start processing the files.

The `request.multipart.file` method lets you select a specific file, and the readable stream is accessed via `file.stream` property. Now you are free to consume the stream by piping it to *s3* or any other service you want.

The entire process is asynchronous and processes the file(s) only once.
